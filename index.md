# Bobiverse 

This page is about my current audible book "The Bobiverse". 
In a fictitious future a Von-Neumann Spacecraft is sent to other sun systems. 
Such a spacecraft is built with the capability to reproduce itself. 
In this book the spacecraft's computer is not just an artificial intelligence. 
No, it actually runs on a brain-copy from Bob who had died before and inherited his "soul" to the sciences.


## Bobiverse Features

* Bob reproduces after reaching his first sun system.
* Bill - Bob's first clone - turns out to have a slightly different character.
  Thus there is a growing community of engineering brains going in different fields of research.
* Bob's clones want to encounter the Univere's secrets and fly away in all directions with under-luminal-speed.
* During the story lines several generations of "Bobs" will reach the Earth's neighboring sun systems.
* Each of the discovered sun systems serves as a platform for new adventures.
* One of the clone even develops a super-luminal communication channel. 
  This technique is broadcasted by common radio and reaches the other clones after years or decades
  who rebuild the technique and join the online channel of this Bobiverse.
* Later even an android body is created who is remotely controlled by its master brain still orbiting in space.
  These android bodies become more and more human-like and the Bobs finally can participate in normal life again.
  Bob has reached multi-immortality.

Bob says about him-/them-selves:
> I am Many
> in All these Worlds
