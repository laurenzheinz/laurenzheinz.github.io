# Bobiverse 

This page is about my current audible book "The Bobiverse". 
In a fictitious future a Von-Neumann Spacecraft is sent to other sun systems. 
Such a spacecraft is built with the capability to reproduce itself. 
Its computer is not just an artificial intelligence. 
No, it actually runs on a brain-copy from Bob who had died before and inherited his "soul" to the sciences.


## Bobiverse Features

* Bob reproduces after reaching his first sun systems
* Bill - Bob's first clone - turns out to have a slightly different character
* Bob's clones want to encounter the Univere's secrets and fly away in all directions with under-luminal-speed
* During the story lines several generations of "Bobs" will reach the Earth's neighboring sun systems
* Each of the discovered sun systems serve as a platform for new adventures
* One of the clone even develops a super-luminal communication channel. 
  This technique is broadcasted by common radio and reaches the other clones after years or decades
* Later even an android body is created who is remotely controlled by its master who now can participate in normal life
